"""ae4130assignment1 package

This package provides example scripts for the use of the panelairfoil package. The examples are taken from the execution
of some tasks of the first assignment (Inviscid flow over an airfoil) of TU Delft's Aircraft Aerodynamics course
(AE4130).

This package requires `numpy` and `matplotlib` to be installed within the Python environment you are using this package
in.

This package contains the following modules:

    * naca0012experimentaldata - defines some functions to retrieve experimental data of NACA 0012
    * task2 - produces plots for task 2 of the assignment, where a comparison of results for NACA 0012 with experimental
     data from literature is requested
    * task3 - produces plots for task 3 of the assignment, where comparisons between a thin and a thick airfoil and
     between a symmetrical and a cambered airfoil are requested
    * task5 - produces plots for task 5 of the assignment, where an assessment of the effect of the panel density is
    requested
